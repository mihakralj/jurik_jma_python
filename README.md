# jurik_jma_python

Python implementation of what is known about proprietarty Jurik's JMA indicator (http://www.jurikres.com/catalog1/ms_ama.htm).
The mechanics are grabbed from https://c.mql5.com/forextsd/forum/164/jurik_1.pdf

Compared to the control data in JMA-test.csv (from http://www.jurikres.com/down__/JMA_test_results_.zip)the implementation is close, but not exact formulation of JMA.
